== Wiktionary Parser ==

This project has the intent to parse the English and German (over time maybe others) wiktionary databases 
and convert them into a machine readable format (database).

This database should allow to answer the following (and more) questions:

- give me all the words for a given category (for example "food") in English and German

- given the following words in English/German, give me all the translated 
German/English words and their pluralizations in English and German in an XML format 
readable by the Android Developer Kit

- give me a list of possible words I can enter based on the current structure of 
the sentence (noun, verb, adjective and so on)

- export the complete database of all known words into a machine readable format like JSON or XML 
or a binary format optimized for reading from flash memory
